- Skills: Incident response, Git recovery commands

### 4. Instructor Materials
**File:** `instructor_guide.md`

**Contains:**
- Detailed class timeline (matches original lesson plan exactly)
- Setup instructions for GitHub Classroom
- Common student challenges and solutions
- Assessment criteria and success indicators
- Resources for continued learning

## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Instructors

### Before Class:
1. **Set up GitHub Classroom:**
   - Create new assignment
   - Upload contents of `starter-code-simple/` as template
   - Test that students can access and run the code

2. **Prepare Materials:**
   - Review `instructor_guide.md` for timeline
   - Print or bookmark breakout exercise files
   - Test all starter code runs correctly

3. **Plan Breakout Rooms:**
   - 3-4 students per room
   - Mixed experience levels if possible
   - Assign rooms for efficient management

### During Class:
1. **Follow Original Lesson Plan Structure:**
   - 6:30-6:45: Opening and assignment overview
   - 6:45-7:05: Workflows and standards lecture
   - 7:05-7:20: Pull request mastery lecture
   - 7:20-7:35: **Breakout 1** - Code review exercise
   - 7:35-7:55: Merge conflicts lecture
   - 7:55-8:05: Break
   - 8:05-8:20: **Breakout 2** - Merge conflict exercise
   - 8:20-8:40: Git recovery and crisis management lecture
   - 8:40-8:55: **Breakout 3** - Crisis management exercise
   - 8:55-9:10: Quality gates and automation lecture
   - 9:10-9:25: Repository setup workshop
   - 9:25-9:30: Wrap-up and next steps

2. **Manage Breakout Sessions:**
   - Students work on their individual GitHub repos
   - Teams discuss approaches and help each other
   - Visit rooms to answer questions and check progress

### After Class:
- Students complete their repositories and documentation
- Grade individual GitHub Classroom submissions
- Provide feedback on professional Git skills demonstrated
