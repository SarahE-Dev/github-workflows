# Getting Started - Professional Git Workflows Class

## For Instructors: Quick Setup

### 1. GitHub Classroom Setup (5 minutes)
1. Go to [classroom.github.com](https://classroom.github.com)
2. Create new assignment: "Professional Git Workflows"
3. **Upload starter code:** Use all files from `starter-code-simple/` directory
4. **Settings:** 
   - Individual assignment
   - Grant students admin access to repositories
   - Enable feedback pull requests
5. **Test:** Create test student account and verify code runs

### 2. Class Preparation (10 minutes)
1. **Review materials:**
   - `instructor_guide.md` - Detailed timeline and teaching notes
   - `github_classroom_assignment.md` - Student instructions
   - `breakout-exercises/` - Three 15-minute exercises

2. **Test starter code:**
   ```bash
   cd starter-code-simple/
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py  # Should run without errors
   ```

3. **Plan breakout rooms:** 3-4 students each, mixed experience levels

### 3. Class Day Checklist
- [ ] Share GitHub Classroom assignment link with students
